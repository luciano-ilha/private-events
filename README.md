 ## Private Events  

## About <a name = "About"></a>
 We built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.
